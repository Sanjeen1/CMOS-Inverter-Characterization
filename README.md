**set color0=white** --> Defines color0 as white. color0 is typically used for the background in waveforms/plots. So this sets the waveform window background to white.

**set color1=black** --> Defines color1 as black. Usually, color1 is used for grid lines or axes.

**set color2=red** --> Defines color2 as red. This color will be used for plotting the first waveform trace. 

**Set color3=blue** --> Defines color3 as blue. This color is used for the second waveform trace.

(Similarly, more colors can be defined for other traces if needed.)

**set xbrushwidth=3** --> Sets the brush width (line thickness) of waveforms to 3. This makes plotted traces thicker, which helps visibility.
