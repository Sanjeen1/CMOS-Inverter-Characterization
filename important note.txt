For standard cmos inverter, sizing of NMOS and PMOS is taken as length(l) to be equal in both NMOS and PMOS. Width of PMOS should be 2 times than width of NMOS

For example -

For PMOS:-
l=5u and w= 20u

For NMOS:-
l=5u and w= 10u

This is the standard sizing of cmos inverter.

All the analysis is done on TSMC 180nm . similarly for sky130 we can include sky130 lib in spice file.
